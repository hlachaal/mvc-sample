# mvc-sample
Snippets of code that I have worked on. A controller, model and a view. Used Codeigniter 3.


## The attached code sample contain:
 
Authorize.php - this is a controller that handles authenticating the user (ie: login,logout).

Base_model.php - this is a base model. I almost always have models inherit this model for the "easy methods" it has. Such as easy_gets, easy_insert, etc. Helps simplify common queries.

login.php - this a "login" form section. Typical bootstrap 3, with some jquery initialization.
